# Automated Network Reconnaissance using Nmap and Bash

## Overview
This project automates network scanning tasks using Nmap and Bash scripting. It is designed to help beginners understand how cybersecurity professionals gather information about computer networks, identify potential vulnerabilities, and create a basic automated tool.

## Objectives
- Understand basic Nmap usage for scanning networks.
- Learn to write Bash scripts to automate common scanning operations.
- Develop a beginner-friendly tool that:
  - Accepts a target IP range or domain.
  - Performs basic scans (ping, port, OS detection).
  - Saves output in organized files.
  - Hosts the completed tool and documentation on GitHub.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
